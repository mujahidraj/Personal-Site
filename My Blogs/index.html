                    <h2>K Nearest Neighbors</h2>

                    <p>
                    <h4>KNN Algorithm Visualization</h4>
                    Here‚Äôs an image of how KNN classifies a new point based on its neighbors.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4> What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?</h4>
                    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and
                    regression tasks. It is a non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm, meaning it makes
                    predictions based on similarity between data points rather than learning an explicit model.

                    <h4>How KNN Works?</h4>
                    Choose a value for K (number of neighbors).

                    Calculate distances between the new data point and all training data points (e.g., Euclidean
                    distance).

                    Find the K nearest neighbors (smallest distances).

                    Classification: Assign the most common class among the K neighbors.
                    Regression: Take the average of the K neighbors‚Äô values.

                    <h4>What Type of Dataset Does KNN Need?</h4>
                    Numerical & Categorical Features (KNN works well with both but requires encoding for categorical
                    data).

                    Balanced Datasets (It struggles with imbalanced datasets).

                    Low-Dimensional Data (KNN performs poorly in high-dimensional spaces due to the curse of
                    dimensionality).

                    Small to Medium Dataset Size (Since KNN stores all data points, large datasets make it slow).

                    <p>

                    <h3>Introduction </h3>
                    Full stack development is one of the most sought-after skills in the tech industry. A full stack
                    developer is someone who is proficient in both frontend and backend development, along with database
                    management. But what exactly does full stack development include? In this blog, we will break down
                    the proper structure of full stack development and explain its key components.


                    <h4>1. Understanding Full Stack Development</h4>

                    Full stack development covers three main layers: <br>
                    1. Frontend (Client-Side Development) ‚Äì The part users interact with. <br>
                    2. Backend (Server-Side Development) ‚Äì The logic and functionality. <br>
                    3. Database Management ‚Äì Where data is stored and retrieved. <br>

                    Each of these layers works together to create a fully functional application.


                    <h4>2. The Proper Structure of Full Stack Development</h4>
                    A full stack development structure can be divided into the following sections:

                    <h5>A. Frontend (Client-Side)</h5>
                    This is the user-facing part of a web application. It includes: <br>
                    - HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The basic structure of web pages. <br>
                    - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Styling and layout of web pages. <br>
                    - JavaScript: Adds interactivity to web pages. <br>
                    - Frameworks/Libraries: React, Angular, or Vue.js for efficient UI development. <br>

                    The frontend is responsible for ensuring that the website is visually appealing, responsive, and
                    user-friendly.

                    <h5>B. Backend (Server-Side)</h5>
                    The backend handles the business logic, processes requests, and communicates with the database. It
                    includes: <br>
                    - Programming Languages: Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, or Ruby. <br>
                    - Frameworks: Express.js (Node.js), Django (Python), Spring Boot (Java), Laravel (PHP). <br>
                    - Authentication & Authorization: JWT, OAuth, and Passport.js for securing user access. <br>
                    - RESTful APIs & GraphQL: To enable communication between the frontend and backend. <br>

                    The backend ensures that the right data is delivered to the frontend efficiently.

                    <h5>C. Database Management</h5>
                    Databases store and manage data for applications. There are two main types: <br>
                    - SQL Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server (structured data storage). <br>
                    - NoSQL Databases: MongoDB, Firebase (flexible and scalable storage). <br>

                    Database management ensures that the application can handle user data securely and efficiently. <br>



                    <h4>3. DevOps & Deployment </h4>
                    A full stack developer should also be familiar with DevOps practices to deploy and maintain
                    applications. This includes: <br>
                    - Version Control Systems: Git, GitHub, GitLab. <br>
                    - Cloud Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure. <br>
                    - Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes. <br>
                    - CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI. <br>

                    These tools help automate the development, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring that
                    applications run smoothly in production.



                    <h4>4. Full Stack Development Workflow </h4>
